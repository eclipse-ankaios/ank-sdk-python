# `sleepy` Example Workload

The `sleepy` example workload is just an "endless-sleep" container that already includes the Ankaios Python SDK. It allows an easy execution of an interactive Python session to connect to the Ankaios cluster.

## Running and stopping the workload

To run or stop the example take a look at the [README](../README.md) in the part folder.

You are also free to run it manually if you want to.
