Classes
-------

- EventQueue:
    Represents a queue of events received from the Ankaios system.
    Inherits from the standard Queue class.

Usage
-----

- Check current state of the followed fields:
    .. code-block:: python

        event_queue: EventQueue
        current_state = event_queue.complete_state

- Get the events out of the queue:
    .. code-block:: python

        event_queue: EventQueue
        event: EventEntry = event_queue.get()  # blocks until an event is available
