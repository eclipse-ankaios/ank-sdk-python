This module defines the LogCampaignResponse and LogQueue classes for handling
log campaigns in the Ankaios system.

Classes
-------

- LogCampaignResponse:
    Represents the response for a log campaign, containing the queue of
    received messages and the accepted workload names.
- LogQueue:
    Represents a queue of received messages through the log campaign.

Usage
-----

- Check the valid workload names:
    .. code-block:: python

        log_campaign: LogCampaignResponse
        valid_workload_names: list = log_campaign.accepted_workload_names

- Get logs out of the queue:
    .. code-block:: python

        log = log_campaign.queue.get()
"""

__all__ = ["LogCampaignResponse", "LogQueue"]

from .workload_state import WorkloadInstanceName
