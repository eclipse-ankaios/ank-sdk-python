This module defines the Manifest class for handling ankaios manifests.

Classes
-------

- Manifest:
    Represents a workload manifest and provides methods \
    to validate and load it.

Usage
-----

- Load a manifest from a file:
    .. code-block:: python

        manifest = Manifest.from_file("path/to/manifest.yaml")

- Load a manifest from a string:
    .. code-block:: python

        manifest = Manifest.from_string("apiVersion: 1.0\\nworkloads: {}")

- Load a manifest from a dictionary:
    .. code-block:: python

        manifest = Manifest.from_dict({"apiVersion": "1.0", "workloads": {}})
